This produced oganesson-294, an isotope with a half-life of about 0.89 milliseconds (0.00089 seconds), and three free neutrons. The californium target was irradiated with a total of 1.6*1019 calcium ions over the course of 1080 hours, resulting in the production of three atoms of oganesson. Oganesson's most stable isotope, oganesson-294, has a half-life of about 0.89 milliseconds. It decays into livermorium-290 through alpha decay.",
