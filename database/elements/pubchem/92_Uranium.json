Radioactivity was first discovered in 1896 when Antoine Henri Becquerel, a French physicist, detected it from a sample of uranium.

The identification of uranium as an element is generally credited to Martin H. Klaproth. While experimenting with pitchblende in 1789, he concluded that it contained a new element, which he named after the newly discovered planet Uranus (named after the Greek god of the sky or heaven).

An ensuing arms race during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union produced tens of thousands of nuclear weapons that used uranium metal and uranium-derived plutonium-239.

Uranium forms a variety of alloys and compounds with the most important oxidation states being uranium(IV) and uranium(VI), and their two corresponding oxides are, respectively, uranium dioxide, UO2 and uranium trioxide, UO3. Besides the oxides, other Important uranium compounds include fluorides, chlorides, bromides, iodides, carbonates, hydrides, carbides, nitrides, phosphates, etc. At room temperatures, uranium hexafluoride, UF6, has a high vapor pressure, making it useful in the gaseous diffusion process used to separate the rare U-235 from the common U-238 isotope.
