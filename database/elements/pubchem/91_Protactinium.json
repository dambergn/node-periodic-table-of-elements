In 1913 the first isotope of element 91, 234Pa, was discovered by K. Fajans and O.H. Gohring.

The name was changed to proto-actinium as being more consistent with the longer-lived characteristics of the most abundant isotope. In 1927, Grosse prepared 2 mg of a white powder, which was shown to be Pa2O5. In 1934 he isolated the element from 0.1 g of pure Pa2O5 by two methods, one of which was by converting the oxide to an iodide and \"cracking\" it in a high vacuum by an electrically heated filament by the reaction: 2PaI5 > 2Pa + 5I2. In 1949, the name protoactinium was shortened by the IUPAC who officially named it protactinium and confirmed Hahn and Meitner as co-discoverers.
