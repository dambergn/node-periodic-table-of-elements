The Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory were able to produce two super-heavy elements by bombarding a rotating 243Am disc with an ion beam of 48Ca in a U-400 cyclotron. During the reaction, isotopes of moscovium, previously known as ununpentium, were synthesized and decayed in a tenth of a second to nihonium, which then decayed to roentgenium. Because the atoms of moscovium only existed for a tenth of a second, radiochemical proof was needed to support its syntheses. A Swiss scientist at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) performed the radiochemical experiment by analyzing a copper plate that had been placed behind the 243Am disc in the cyclotron. This copper plate collected all moscovium atoms that were synthesized and was processed through liquid chromatography techniques that yielded five times more moscovium atoms than produced by fusion alone. The direct synthesis of nihonium was announced later that year by a team of Japanese scientists from the Cyclotron Center of the RIKEN Research Institute. These scientists bombarded atoms of 209Bi with a beam of 70Zn in a RIKEN heavy-ion linear accelerator (RILAC), shown in Fig. IUPAC.113.1, and gas-filled recoil ion separator (GARIS), shown in Fig. IUPAC.113.2.
